  <h1>Privacy Policy for MOMAH</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23/4/2024</p>
  <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes the data handling practices of MOMAH, a mobile application developed as a graduation project for students at the Department of Agricultural Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Banha University. The app is designed to assist agricultural engineers in calculating the evapotranspiration crop coefficient (ETc) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using data from meteorological stations in the Arab Republic of Egypt, following FAO guidelines.</p>

  <h2>1. DATA WE DO NOT COLLECT</h2>
  <p>MOMAH does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. The app operates completely offline without transmitting any user inputted data externally. All calculations and data processing are performed locally on the user's device.</p>

  <h2>2. INFORMATION USAGE</h2>
  <p>The user inputs required by MOMAH, such as the selection of the nearest meteorological station, type of crop, growth period, and type of soil, are solely for the purpose of performing the necessary calculations to design drip irrigation systems. The app does not use this information for any other purpose nor does it store this information once the app is closed.</p>

  <h2>3. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.</p>
